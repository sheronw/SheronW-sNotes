Little Endian"},{"location":"computer%20science/Concurrency/","text":"Concurrency Basic Concepts Threads The fundamental unit of execution within an application. Each thread has its own stack and runs independently from other threads (but they share resources by default). data corruption : a side effect when two threads write data to memory at the same time Implementation: native/kernel-level threads : threads managed by OS green threads : threads implemented by software layers such as VM preemptive threading : OS switches from thread to thread, giving each thread short time to run context switch : suspend one thread to let another thread run System Threads vs User Threads System thread is the thread created and managed by the system, and it is the first and the main thread of the application. Usually application will stop when system thread stops. User Thread is created by application to do other tasks such as handling network or user interface then sending events to main thread. Monitors and Semaphores Two threads synchronization mechanisms. monitor : set of routines protected by a mutual exclusion lock A thread could execute only when it has a lock and only one thread could have the lock at the same time. A thread that has the lock could waiting for some events and suspend using this routine, and the other waiting thread could do their job at that time. When event occurs, the previous thread could could back. semaphore : a lock that protects a shared resource, have to acquire and release the lock manually, so it is a simpler construct with more complex usage mutex semaphore: one thread acquire the lock and other wait until unblocked then enter counting semaphores: maximum of n threads at a given time event semaphores: notify other threads when an event occurred System will usually report error or timeout if cannot acquire the resource in a certain time. Also, it will be slower when using thread-free features so many library will provide to versions for better performance or safety need. Dead Locks \u9677 \u5165 \u50f5 \u5c40 Means each thread got permanently stalled when each cannot run to the point of releasing the lock that the other needs. Similar thing happens in SQL transaction. How to: when needs to acquire several locks, always acquire the locks in the same order and release them in the same reverse order. This will be hard to implement in big projects, though. Node.js cluster mode: distribute processes to different cores worker threads: a new thread that could communicate with main thread (using Promise, for example) and handle some time consuming jobs Here're two easy examples (the second one did not handle thread re-use): Busy Waiting Busy waiting means a thread create another thread to do work, continue active but do nothing but using processor cycles, just to wait for the other thread finish the job. We could use monitor or semaphore to avoid it. For example, lock the previous process until the second one ends and notify it. However, if it takes more time to acquire a lock than finish the task, it is more efficient to use a spinlock that busy waiting for a little bit of time. Another possibility is one thread per core, and the first core need to receive data from the second core to do works next. However, this circumstance is rare in high-level languages. Producer/Consumer Two threads share a fixed-size buffer and index to access buffer. The producer thread place number into the buffer and the consumer thread remove the number from the buffer. It is pretty easy to write a non-concurrent version of it, just create two threads that add numbers and remove numbers respectively while true. However, while true leads to busy waiting, and if they are using the common index without concurrency control, one thread might update index and does nothing then another thread using the wrong index. What about changing add or remove function to synchronized function in Java (for example)? When the buffer is empty and remove got called, the producer thread have to busy waiting it end forever. And it is the same when the buffer is full and add got called. Even for the other cases, another thread have to busy waiting for another thread to do the add or remove job then enter. So we need to add this condition to the code, when buffer is full during add or empty during remove, we should lock this thread until the buffer is not full or empty. Also, after each remove or add procedure finished successfully, the thread should notify the other one. The Dining Philosophers Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of spaghetti. Forks are placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers. Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat spaghetti when they have both left and right forks. Each fork can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the fork only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both forks so that the forks become available to others. A philosopher can only take the fork on their right or the one on their left as they become available and they cannot start eating before getting both forks. Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of spaghetti or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed. Dining philosophers problem, Wikipedia First of all, just as the last problem, we could figure out one algorithm without considering concurrency, that is, for each philosopher: wait for the left fork available wait for the right fork for available eat for a while put both forks down and repeat all above However, this algorithm might leads to a deadlock: for example, all philosophers get the left for available, and they are all waiting for the right fork. As there are only five forks in total this situation will last forever. The easiest way to prevent them stay hungry forever is to add a timeout mechanism. If one philosopher hold the left fork and wait for a certain amount of time, then he or she could just put the left fork down. However, even this will work, but it cannot prevent philosophers from reaching the deadlock state. Let's see what else we could do. If we mimic the process of picking left fork one by one, the deadlock will happen when the fifth philosopher picks the left fork. So what we could do is to let the last philosopher to pick up the right fork first, which means, if we order the forks from 0 to 4, each philosopher must pick up the available forks that has a smaller order. But in the real world, it is not that practical as we cannot know all details of the huge data we are processing. Also, we could set up a condition that only 4 philosophers could hold the fork(s) at one time, and the result is similar. But the method benefits the philosopher in the middle a lot more than others. We could change the rule a little bit, instead of letting all philosophers wait for the left fork then right fork, we could let the odd user pick up left then right while let the even user pick up right then left, which means, if we order the forks from 0 to 4, always force philosophers pick odd forks first. Then we could find that the \"competition\" for forks got separated into groups in stead of a long line for the whole table. Or also, we could introduce a waiter to force the philosopher to pick up the two forks at the same time or just pick up nothing. As there is only one waiter, there could be only one philosopher that gets the permission to pick up both forks at one time.","title":"Concurrency"},{"location":"computer%20science/Concurrency/#concurrency","text":"","title":"Concurrency"},{"location":"computer%20science/Concurrency/#basic-concepts","text":"","title":"Basic Concepts"},{"location":"computer%20science/Concurrency/#threads","text":"The fundamental unit of execution within an application.

As there is only one waiter, there could be only one philosopher that gets the permission to pick up both forks at one time.","title":"The Dining Philosophers"},{"location":"computer%20science/bit_level_operators/","text":"\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26 Java << left shift >> signed right shift (filled with sign bits) >>> unsigned right shift (filled with 0s) & bitwise and | bitwise or ^ bitwise exclusive or C \u5927\u81f4\u4e0e Java \u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u6ca1\u6709 unsigned right shift\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u4f1a\u600e\u4e48 shift \u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u3002 \u4e00\u4e9b\u7528\u6cd5 set bits to 0 x&0=0 x&1=x set bits to 1 x|0=x x|1=1 invert bits x^0=x x^1=!x 1 \u7684\u4e2a\u6570 \u5f53\u521d\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u9053\u9898\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7528\u7684\u662f Java\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9996\u5148\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u662f unsigned right shift \u7136\u540e\u518d left shift \u56de\u6765\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5982\u679c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8bdd\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f4d\u4e3a 0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5219\u4e3a 1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u540c\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5224\u65ad\u4e0b\u4e00\u4f4d\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u5b57\u672c\u8eab\u4e3a 0\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u5b57\u4e00\u5171\u6709 n \u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a O(n)\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u60c5\u51b5\u662f O(1)\u3002 \u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\u5982\u679c\u7528 mask \u7684\u8bdd\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053 x & 1 \u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u6700\u53f3\u4f4d\u662f 1 \u8fd8\u662f\u96f6\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u53ea\u8981\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u4e2a n \u6b21\u7684\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u4e0d\u65ad\u5411\u5de6 shift \u5224\u65ad\u6bcf\u4e00\u4f4d\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u5b57\u672c\u8eab\u4e3a 0 \u5373\u53ef\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8bdd\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e5f\u4e3a O(n)\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u53f3\u4e00\u5de6 shift \u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u6b21 AND \u64cd\u4f5c\u3002 \u66f4\u9ad8\u9636\u7684\u89e3\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e9b\u5bf9\u4f4d\u8fd0\u7b97\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u3002\u4e3a\u65b9\u4fbf\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u4ee5 10101000 \u8fd9\u4e2a\u516b\u4f4d\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff1a \u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u51cf\u4e00\uff0c\u6700\u672b\u4f4d\u7684 1 \u53d8\u6210 0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6700\u672b\u4f4d\u540e\u7684 0 \u5168\u90e8\u53d8\u6210 1\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982 10101000 - 1 = 10100111 \u5c06\u65b0\u6570\u5b57\u4e0e\u539f\u6570\u5b57\u76f8 AND \u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6570\u5b57\uff0c\u9664\u6700\u672b\u4f4d\u7684 1 \u53d8\u6210 0 \u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u90fd\u4e0e\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u539f\u6570\u5b57\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982 10100111 & 10101000 = 10100000 \uff0c\u81f3\u6b64\u6211\u4eec\u8df3\u8fc7\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u672b\u5c3e 0\uff0c\u53ea\u6267\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c31\u5224\u65ad\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a 1 \u540c\u7406\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd0\u7b97\uff1a 10100000 - 1 = 10011111 \uff0c 10011111 & 10100000 = 10000000 \uff0c\u53c8\u5224\u65ad\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21 1 \u7ee7\u7eed\u8fd0\u7b97\uff1a 10000000 - 1 = 01111111 \uff0c 01111111 & 10000000 = 0 \uff0c\u53c8\u5224\u65ad\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21 1 \u6570\u5b57\u4e3a 0 \u505c\u6b62\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4e00\u5171\u6709 3 \u4e2a 1 \u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u5b57\u4e2d\u6709 m \u4e2a 1\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a O(m)\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8981\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u89e3\u6cd5\u3002 function count1(n) { let count = 0;

Evaluation Function We could design the evaluation function according to the experience of all human being in the history of chess. We could count the number of pieces, types of pieces or some certain piece in some certain position, etc. We could also use machine learning to calculate the coeffecient of the function.

Normalization Functional dependencies in a relation are removed by decomposing it into several smaller relations. why we need normalization relation anomalies because of different forms of redundancy in relations redundancy, update anomaly, deletion anomaly first normal form (1NF) 1NF has no multivalued attributes, that is, it is a flat file. All relations as we have defined them are in 1NF. second normal form (2NF) 2NF possesses key completeness , that is, every non-prime attribute(an attribute which is not part of a candidate key) depends on the entire primary key(not on a proper subset of it). third normal form (3NF) For each nontrivial(Y is not a subset of X) functional dependency X \\Rightarrow Y , either X is a superkey or Y contains no non-prime attributes. Boyce Codd normal form (BCNF) For each nontrivial functional dependency X \\Rightarrow Y , X is a superkey. Every BCNF is also 2NF and 3NF. normalization procedure let R(A) be a relation and A be its set of attributes Suppose R has a functional dependency X \\Rightarrow Y , where X is not super key. Decompose R into two relationships: R_1(X+) and R_2(X \\cup (A-X+)) . Then apply this recursively to both R_1 and R_2 . chase test (example in lecture 11) general procedure for determining whether or not a given decomposition is lossless If we can reduce a row in the tableau to the original tuple, then the join is lossless. forth normal form (4NF) multivalued dependency : occurs when a relation has more than one independent, multivalued attribute (A determines B and C, but B and C are independent) A 4NF relation means it is in BCNF and no multivalued dependencies.

Composition VS Inheritance? Problem of Inheritance Sometimes a parent class cannot handle everything. If we want to divided those children into catagories, one for each feature, then there will be so many subclasses which is not good for the maintainability and readability. Why use composition We could use composition, interface or delegation to solve the problem above. First of all, we could try to create interfaces for every features, and let the certain class implement these features. The problems is that all methods in interfaces are abstract methods and we still need to implement all the methods one by one in each class. How to solve this problem? We could use composition and delegation. We could create implementation classes for all those interfaces and composite those implementation classes into each child class, for example, as a private variable. Composition or Inheritance? As the example above, using composition instead of inheritance requires more granular codes. Then it is not good for maintainability and readability. So if the system is stable and the inheritance relationship is shallow, then we could still use inheritance. And some certain design patterns requires the usage of inheritance.

Sometime it could be a substitute for global variable, but it cannot solve the state problems of global variable so it is an anti-pattern. However, because it is a class so it can inherit from base class or interfaces, and it could changed to some kind of normal class easily in the future. It might slow down the speed and hold resources because it has be initialized at the beginning and always keep running until the application ends. Builder Instead of creating an object by yourself, you create a builder and let it create the object for you. Even though it sounds like something useless, in usage it could make the code easier to understand and to add or remove parameters when needed, and also, prevent initialization errors. It should be used when create complicated objects or objects that need to be created in multiple steps. It is also useful to create sub-classes of the builder for specific and customized usages. Iterator Many programming languages will have that built-in feature. It could let you iterate through the elements in a data structure without knowing how the elements are stored or represented. Observer Also called Publish-Subscribe Pattern , this will let objects broadcasts changes in state to other registered objects without needing to know much about them. An example for this design pattern is the MVC separation. Changes in model will cause the views to redraw themselves. Decorator Or Wrapping Pattern , which wraps an object with another one that derived from the same base class. It could modify the behavior by performing some additional processes before or after. the prototypical implementation: Component: abstract class/interface to define the object and the decorator Concrete Component: the real class of underlying object Decorator: the (typically abstract) class to provide the functionality shared by decorator and wrap the Concrete Component, forward the method call, etc. Concrete Decorator: override Decorator class to modify the behavior of wrapped Concrete Components, usually there are more than one Concrete Decorators to modify the Concrete Components accordingly Singleton Implementation Your application uses a logging class to write debugging messages to the console. How would you implement this logging facility using the singleton pattern? The easiest thing to do is to initialize the logger inside of the class, and make the constructor private so that no one could initialize it. public class Logger { private static Logger instance = new Logger(); private Logger() {} public static Logger getInstance() { return instance; } } Your application uses a singleton, but it is not always necessary, and it is expensive to initialize. How can you improve it? Alright, even the Logger class could be initialized, you could create the logger instance until getInstance() is called, this is called deferred initialization or lazy loading. Here are some features of it: faster startup time even it could be slow when call getInstance() for the first time if the singleton is never accessed the time and resources could be saved you could still make some workaround so that the user could choose whether to initialize the instance at compile time or running time when the environment is recourse-limited the instance initialization might failed while running it will increase the complexity of the singleton class especially for multi-threaded system public class Logger { private static Logger instance = null; private Logger() {} public static Logger getInstance() { if (instance==null) { instance = new Logger(); } return instance; } } As we said before, it is not safe for multi-threaded system, let's see what else we could do to protect it. First of all, you could add synchronized tag before the getInstance() method so that the creation process could be locked. However, we just need to initialize the new logger instance for only once while might need to call getInstance() for several times, if make the whole method synchronized then the speed will go down. You could make an inner class that performs deferred loading, even it increases the complexity of the code. public class Logger { private static Logger instance = null; private Logger() {} private static class LoggerHolder { public static final Logger instance = new Logger(); } public static Logger getInstance() { return LoggerHolder.instance; } } Decorator versus Inheritance Why would you use the decorator instead of inheritance? Inheritance could only modify the behavior at compiling time but decorator could change it dynamically. If you want to do something dynamically when using the interface you have to create an new object every time when changing the behavior. Also, decorator could be applied in any kinds of combination as long as they don't interfere others (you have to be careful to make them mutually non-interfering when implementing concrete decorator classes). However, because decorator is more complex than inheritance, when there is no need to modify the behavior dynamically you should stick with inheritance. And decorator generally don't expose new public methods. Efficient Observer Updates In the observer pattern, what strategies can be the subject use to efficiently update its observers?

How would you implement this logging facility using the singleton pattern? The easiest thing to do is to initialize the logger inside of the class, and make the constructor private so that no one could initialize it. public class Logger { private static Logger instance = new Logger(); private Logger() {} public static Logger getInstance() { return instance; } } Your application uses a singleton, but it is not always necessary, and it is expensive to initialize. How can you improve it? Alright, even the Logger class could be initialized, you could create the logger instance until getInstance() is called, this is called deferred initialization or lazy loading. Here are some features of it: faster startup time even it could be slow when call getInstance() for the first time if the singleton is never accessed the time and resources could be saved you could still make some workaround so that the user could choose whether to initialize the instance at compile time or running time when the environment is recourse-limited the instance initialization might failed while running it will increase the complexity of the singleton class especially for multi-threaded system public class Logger { private static Logger instance = null; private Logger() {} public static Logger getInstance() { if (instance==null) { instance = new Logger(); } return instance; } } As we said before, it is not safe for multi-threaded system, let's see what else we could do to protect it. First of all, you could add synchronized tag before the getInstance() method so that the creation process could be locked. However, we just need to initialize the new logger instance for only once while might need to call getInstance() for several times, if make the whole method synchronized then the speed will go down. You could make an inner class that performs deferred loading, even it increases the complexity of the code. public class Logger { private static Logger instance = null; private Logger() {} private static class LoggerHolder { public static final Logger instance = new Logger(); } public static Logger getInstance() { return LoggerHolder.instance; } }","title":"Singleton Implementation"},{"location":"computer%20science/design%20patterns/02%20basic%20design%20pattern%20definitions/#decorator-versus-inheritance","text":"Why would you use the decorator instead of inheritance?

To Deal with nullable symbols in the grammar: remove all nullable symbols if there is a rule that has only 1 nullable symbol on the right, then change this rule into original rule | rule without this symbol (X => aYb, if Y is nullable then change it to X=> aYb | ab) similarly, if there is a rule that has m nullable symbols, replace this rule into conbination of 2^m possible rules(exist or not exist) Step 2: Eliminate unit rules. (A, C) is a unit pair if A=>B, B=>C. This kind of forms is not allowed in CNF. To find any unit pairs, first we mark all nonterminal Symbol(A,A). If (A, B) is marked and A=>C, then we mark(C,B). Continue this procedure until no more pair could be marked. To deal with unit rules in the grammar G: create a new empty grammar G' for each unit pair (A, B), if B=>a in G, then add A=>a to G' Step 3: Eliminate all symbols that aren't generating. Using a stack, go from terminal symbols only to S, mark any symbol meets, then delete unmarked symbols. Step 4: Eliminate all symbols that aren't reachable. Similarly, using a stack, go from S to terminal symbols, mark any symbol meets, then delete unmarked symbols. The sequence of 3 and 4 matters, if we remove unreachable then ungenerating, we will have some rules that has some symbol X on the left hand side that start state cannot go to(two states that has no connections). Because we could go to this X before we move all ungenerating rules, so it is left. Step 5: Substitute terminal symbols. For any grammar A = X_1\\cdots X_i\\cdots X_n where n>1 , if X_i is a terminal symbol, then we substitue X_i using A_i and add a new rule A_i \\Rightarrow X_i . Step 6: Split long rules. For any grammar A = X_1\\cdots X_n where n>2, make a new set of rules: A \\Rightarrow X_1B_1 B_1 \\Rightarrow X_2B_2 \\cdots B_{n-3} \\Rightarrow X_{n-2}B_{n-2} B_{n-2}\\Rightarrow X_{n-1}X_n Where B_i are new nonterminal symbols.

Recursive & Recursively Enumerable A language L is recursive if L=L(M) for some Turing machine M such that: If w is in L, then M accepts and halts. If w is not in L, then M eventually halts, although it never enters an accepting state. If the language is recursive then it is accepted by a TM that always halts.( Decider ) A language L is recursively enumerable if L=L(M) for some TM M , but necessary halts for all input. ( Recognizer ) Not RE > RE > R If a language is recursive, then its complement is also recursive. If a language and its complement are both recursively enumerable, then the langauge is recursive. A language that's not recursively enumerable present TM as a binary string Represent state q_i with 0^i Number the tape symbols X_1 \\cdots X_n and represent X_i with 0^i Encode the directions L as 01 and R as 02 Encode the transition \\delta(q_i,X_j)=(q_k,X_l,D_m) as 0^i10^j10^k10^l10^m Encode the complete transition function as t_111t_211 \\cdots 11t_n where the t_i are the encodings of the individual transitions Encode the TM with final state t_n as T1110^n where T is the encoding of the transition function diagonalization language The language L_d , the diagonalization language, is the set of strings w_i such that w_i is not in L(M_i) . Because we could write every TM as binary string and binary string is countable, so we could list all TMs as M_1 \\cdots M_i \\cdots whose code is w_1 \\cdots w_i \\cdots . Not all binary string could represent valid TM, of course. So we could consider them as TMs that accept no string including empty string. Then we could construct a table that could represented the characteristic vectors of each languages. Each row means a language and each column is a string, if accept then this cell is 1 and 0 otherwise. In order to construct L_d , we are using the same trick in discrete math. We could find the diagonal value of this table and flip them. For example, if in the table M_i accepts w_i then w_i is not in L_d . L_d is not recursively enumerable No TM could accepts L_d . Still the same trick in discrete math. Suppose L_d = L(M) for some TM M . Then M should be some M_i . If w_i \\in L_d , then M_i should accepts w_i , but according to the def of L_d , w_i is not in L_d . Contradiction. If w_i \\notin L_d , then M_i should not accepts w_i , but according to the def of L_d , w_i is in L_d . Contradiction. So M not exists. L_d is not recursively enumerable. A language that's RE but not Recursive The universal language L_u is {m1111w | m is the encoding of a TM M and w is an input string and M accepts w}. Universal Language is RE We need to build a TM for it. This TM has 3 tapes. 1st tape: the string content m1111w 2nd tape: one track for the current string w, the other track is the pointer of the current tape symbol(this tape is to simulate the TM m) 3rd tape: to record the current state of TM m For the given string m1111w, first put it to 1st tape, then copy w to the 2nd tape and put the pointer to the start of the string. Then go back to 1st tape and read the start state then write to 3rd tape. Then, we check the current state on 3rd tape and check the next symbol on 2nd tape, then go back to 1st tape part m to see what should do next. We could go to a final state and halt if m accepts w. Universal Language is not Recursive We will prove it by proving that the complement of universal language is not recursive enumerable. Suppose the complement of universal language is recursive enumerable, then we could build a Turing Machine T for it. We then make a new TM T'(w) = T(w1111w) such that T' accepts w when T cannot accept w1111w. Then T' should accept w when w is in diagonal language. But diagonal language is not RE, so there should be no T' or T. Rice's Theorem: Nothing Decidable Version 1 Let Q be any non-trivial property of recursively enumerable languages. Then Q is undecidable. We identify a property of a language with the set of TMs that accept the languages with this property. A non-trivial property is one that applies to some but not all languages. Version 2 Let a be any set of TM. Let \\textbf{a*} = \\{M |\\text{ M is a TM that accepts the same languages as some TM in a }\\} Then if a^* is neither empty nor the set of all TM, then a^* must be undecidable. Proof Let Grumpy be the TM that doesn't accept any string. First assume a^* doesn't include Grumpy. It is clear that a^* isn't empty. Let M^* be any particular TM in a^* . We will use the decider of a^* to build a decider for L_u , as follows: Given any pair (M, w), build a new TM M', such that: M'(x) = \\begin{cases} M^*(x) &\\text{if M accepts w}\\\\ M(x) &\\text{if M doesn't accept w} \\end{cases} If M cannot accept w, then M'(w) = M(w) , both M and M' cannot recognize and accept w. M' cannot accept any string that cannot accepted by M, so M' is equivalent to Grumpy and not in a^* . However, we assumed that a^* doesn't include Grumpy. Contradiction. If M does accept w, then M'(w) = M^*(w) , that is, M' could accept the same string as some M^* in a^* . So M' is in a^* . Then, a decider for a^* M' could only be M*(x) , which will decide if M accepts w. So it will decide universal language. So the decider of a^* is not exist and a^* is undecidable.","title":"4.1 Undecidability"},{"location":"computer%20science/theory%20of%20computation/4-1%20Undecidability/#41-undecidability","text":"Divide TM into two catagories: TMs that halts whether or not it accepts its input TMs that may run forever on inputs they don't accept So we have to show some problems to be undecidable. i.e. Does this TM accept this input?","title":"4.1 Undecidability"},{"location":"computer%20science/theory%20of%20computation/4-1%20Undecidability/#recursive-recursively-enumerable","text":"A language L is recursive if L=L(M) for some Turing machine M such that: If w is in L, then M accepts and halts.

Then Q is undecidable. We identify a property of a language with the set of TMs that accept the languages with this property. A non-trivial property is one that applies to some but not all languages. Version 2 Let a be any set of TM. Let \\textbf{a*} = \\{M |\\text{ M is a TM that accepts the same languages as some TM in a }\\} Then if a^* is neither empty nor the set of all TM, then a^* must be undecidable. Proof Let Grumpy be the TM that doesn't accept any string. First assume a^* doesn't include Grumpy. It is clear that a^* isn't empty. Let M^* be any particular TM in a^* . We will use the decider of a^* to build a decider for L_u , as follows: Given any pair (M, w), build a new TM M', such that: M'(x) = \\begin{cases} M^*(x) &\\text{if M accepts w}\\\\ M(x) &\\text{if M doesn't accept w} \\end{cases} If M cannot accept w, then M'(w) = M(w) , both M and M' cannot recognize and accept w. M' cannot accept any string that cannot accepted by M, so M' is equivalent to Grumpy and not in a^* . However, we assumed that a^* doesn't include Grumpy. Contradiction. If M does accept w, then M'(w) = M^*(w) , that is, M' could accept the same string as some M^* in a^* . So M' is in a^* . Then, a decider for a^* M' could only be M*(x) , which will decide if M accepts w. So it will decide universal language.
