# 1.2 nondeterminism

- Determinism(DFA) is a subset of nondeterminism(NFA).
- For each letter in DFA, it could only be on only one arrow.
- NFA may have \(\varepsilon\) on the arrowï¼Œmeans one or many arrows may exit from this state(zero).
- If a string in a branch is accepted, then NFA accepts the input string.

## Formal Def of NFA
A nondeterministic finite automation is a 5-tuple(\(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\)), where:

- \(Q\) is a Finite set of states
- \(\Sigma\) is a finite alphabet
- \(\delta : Q \times \Sigma_{\varepsilon} \rightarrow P(Q)\) is the transition function
- \(q_0 \in Q\) is the start state
- \(F \subseteq Q\) is the set of accept states

Formal Def of **computation** for an NFA:

Let N=(\(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F\)) be an NFA and \(w\) a string over the alphabet \(\Sigma\). Then we say that N asscepts \(w\) if we can write \(w\) as \(w=y_1 y_2 \cdots y_m\), where each \(y_i\) is a member of \(\Sigma_{\varepsilon}\) and a sequence of states \(r_0, r_1, \cdots, r_m\) exists in \(Q\) with the following three conditions:

- \(r_0 = q_0\)
- \(r_{i+1} \in \delta (r_i, y_{i+1}) \text{ , for } i=0, \cdots, m-1\)
- \(r_m \in F\)

## Equivalence of NFAs & DFAs
Two machines are equivalent if they recognize the same language.

Every nondeterministic finite automation has an equivalent deterministic finite automation.
