# Epidemiology

## Basic Definitions

**attack rate**: the % of people who get sick after exposing to something

**relative risk**: the % who become ill in one group divided by the % who become ill in another group, i.e. the ratio of two attack rates

**case & control** 实验组与对照组？

**incidence & prevalence**: Thinking about a tank of prevalent cases, then the incident cases shoud come in while dealth or recovery should come out.

**prevalence**: number with the disease/population size

prevalence depends on incidence rate and duration: 

$P/(1-P) \approx IR \times D$

**incidence**: number of new cases/population size at risk

**case-fatality ratio**: the percent of people with the condition who die in a time period (death/cases)

**age-adjusted death rate**:

$\sum_{\text{age group}} age \% \times \text{CFR by age}$
