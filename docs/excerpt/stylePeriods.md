# Three Style Periods of the Common Practice Era

The Western Art Music that is colloquially referred to as “Classical Music,” is often what we refer to as the music written during the Common Practice Era. This music is described as tonal, meaning that its pitch structures are organized using the system of major and minor keys and harmonic patterns that we’ve studied in this class. (Pitch structure in music written before the Baroque era and from the 20th-century to the present often follows different organizing principles.)

The Common Practice Era is often divided into three stylistic eras: Baroque, Classical, Romantic. Of course, composers don’t just wake up one day and decide to write in a new style, so the boundaries between these periods are somewhat artificial. That said, it’s quite incredible how quickly musical style changed in just 200 years, from 1700 to 1900. These three style periods give us a good introductory framework to differentiate the musical style of Western Art Music in this time period.

The list below is certainly not comprehensive, specifically with regards to genres and composers, but it does include many well-known genres and famous composers.
