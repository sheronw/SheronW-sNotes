# Cognitive Walkthrough Method

Users like to learn software by exploration, instead of formal training.

Evaluate a proposed interface in the context of one or more specific user tasks.

## Detailed  Description

Two phases:

- preparatory phase: define input such as tasks, action sequences, uer population, interface to be analysed
- analysis phase: real work, i.e. walk through all actions of all tasks

### Define Inputs

1. Who will be the users of the system?(specific background exprience or knowledge for both **interface** and **task**)
2. What tasks will be analyzed?(should be concrete and realistic)
3. What is the correct action sequence for each task and how is it described?(how the user is expected to view the task before learning the interface + a description of the sequence of actions that should accomplish the task with the current definition of the interface)
4. How is the interface defined?(Description of prompts before every action)

### Walking Through the Actions
